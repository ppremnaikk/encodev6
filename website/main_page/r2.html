                Q1. You have been given a string as input. Your task is to examine the characters in this string and identify the number of distinct and unique substrings that can be generated from it. A valid substring should not contain any repeating characters. After performing this analysis, your program should display both the count of such unique substrings and print these substrings themselves.

                Q2. Imagine you are given a set of strings. Your goal is to determine the longest common prefix among these strings. In other words, you need to find the sequence of characters that appears at the beginning of each string. To accomplish this, design a program that accepts this set of strings and outputs the longest prefix that is shared among them.

                Q3. Suppose you are tasked with implementing your own version of a dictionary data structure, but with a twist: you're not allowed to use the built-in dictionary data type in Python. Instead, you need to create a system that allows you to store key-value pairs and retrieve values using their corresponding keys. Develop a program that demonstrates this custom dictionary structure and its functionality.

                Imagine you are working on constructing a singly linked list. Your job is to design a program that simulates the creation of a linked list, where each element contains a value and a reference to the next element in the list. This data structure should allow you to efficiently insert, delete, and search for elements. Your task is to create and showcase the functionality of this singly linked list in Python.

                Suppose you are presented with a mathematical challenge involving Pascal's Triangle. The task is to compute the result of raising the sum of two variables, 'a' and 'b', to the power of 'n', where 'n' is a positive integer not exceeding 6. You are required to use the values from Pascal's Triangle to calculate this result accurately. Write a program that takes the values of 'a', 'b', and 'n' as input and produces the final outcome using Pascal's Triangle-based calculations.
